The Beman Project is dedicated to providing the guidance and facilities to ensure the highest quality libraries in ISO standard C++. We help library authors with development best practices, peer review, and contributing to the C++ standard. We distribute the libraries that are proposed to for standardization to ensure feedback ahead of standardization.
