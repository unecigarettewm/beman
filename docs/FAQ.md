# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the relationship between the Beman Project and the Boost Foundation?

While both Beman Project and Boost strive to provide high-quality C++ libraries to the community, the Beman Project is specifically focused on fostering works that can be adopted by the standard library.

## Do I have to write a WG21 C++ Standards Committee Paper before I can contribute to the Beman Project?

No! The Beman Project wants to work with you, with experience, feedback, and expertise. Obviously, a paper must be written before becoming accepted as part of the standard, but that paper can be written in tandem with your library development.

In fact, there are plenty of papers already written that need an implementation before they can progress in through the standards track. You can contribute to the Beman project by finding a paper that interests you and working on its library.

Please reach out to the Beman Project Leads to help get your specific project started.

## I have a library that isn't appropriate for the C++ standard. Can I contribute it to the Beman Project?

The Beman Project is dedicated to getting the highest quality libraries through the rigorous effort of standardization. Libraries not falling in this category are out of scope.

## I have a personal/work project but I have no interest in it becoming a standard library. Does the Beman Project have anything for me?

Yes! In our effort to create the highest-quality C++ libraries, we've established a set of templates, tools, and guidelines that are broadly applicable even for projects not destined to be standardized. 

* Our [Example Project](https://github.com/beman-project/example) demonstrates a useful structure for organizing libraries.
* Our [CI Project](https://github.com/beman-project/ci) utilizes Github Workflows to automate building, testing, and releasing libraries.
