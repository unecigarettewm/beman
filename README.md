# Project Beman

The Beman Projectâ€™s [mission](docs/missionstatement.md) is to **support the efficient design and adoption of the highest quality C++ standard libraries** through implementation experience, user feedback, and technical expertise.

---

We have two principle audiances: Library Developers and the C++ community.  We want to allow Library Developers to have a clear path on the road to Standardization.  And we want to make it easy for the C++ community to use these libraries to ensure we have real world usage.

---

This project is organized by our [Governance structure](docs/governance.md).
