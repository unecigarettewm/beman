# Project Beman

## [Our Mission](docs/missionstatement.md):

The Beman Project is dedicated to providing the guidance and facilities to ensure the highest quality libraries in ISO standard C++. We help library authors with development best practices, peer review, and contributing to the C++ standard. We distribute the libraries that are proposed to for standardization to ensure feedback ahead of standardization.

We have two principle audiances: Library Developers and the C++ community.  We want to allow Library Developers to have a clear path on the road to Standardization.  And we want to make it easy for the C++ community to use these libraries to ensure we have real world usage.

This project is organized by our [Governance structure](docs/governance.md).
