# The Beman Project

## About

### Mission

The Beman Projectâ€™s [mission](docs/missionstatement.md) is to **support the efficient design and adoption of the highest quality C++ standard libraries** through implementation experience, user feedback, and technical expertise.

### Community

We have two principle audiences: Library Developers and the C++ community.  We want to allow Library Developers to have a clear path on the road to Standardization.  And we want to make it easy for the C++ community to use these libraries to ensure we have real world usage.

### Governance

This project is organized by our [Governance structure](docs/governance.md).

### About the Name

The Beman project is named in memory of Beman Dawes - co-founder of [Boost](https://www.boost.org).


## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/beman-org/beman.git
$ cd beman
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
$ ctest --test-dir build
```

### CMake Configuration Options

#### `BEMAN_USE_MAIN_BRANCHES`

*Type*: BOOL

*Default*: OFF

By default, the CMake workflow in this repo will clone and build all constituent libraries from git refs as specified in `git_tag` fields in `libraries.json`. If you would instead like to get the *latest* of each library, provide `-DBEMAN_USE_MAIN_BRANCHES=ON` when configuring your CMake build. Be aware that `BEMAN_USE_MAIN_BRANCHES=ON` can result in a less stable user experience as some versions of some libraries may not be published or even fully tested yet.

## Adding a Library

Libraries are enumerated in `libraries.json` in this repository. To add a library to The Beman Project, create a pull request adding a new object to the `libraries` field in that JSON file.

### Library Object JSON Schema

### Example

This is an example JSON object representing a Beman Project library:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "git_repository": "https://github.com/beman-project/example.git",
  "git_tag": "375f3e7",
  "default_branch": "main"
}
```

#### `name`

*Type*: String

A *unique*, logical name for the library.

#### `git_repository`

*Type*: String

A URL for cloning the repository containing the library. This URL does not need to be part of the `beman-project` GitHub organization, or even on GitHub as long as the repo is publicly accessible for cloning.

#### `git_tag`

*Type*: String

A git reference (tag, branch, commit, etc.) that contains a known-working version of the provided library. It is recommended to keep this field up-to-date as the library project and its associated paper evolves.

#### `default_branch`

*Type*: String

The default branch of the library repository, such as `main`. This will be used in workflows where users want the *latest* version of every library, regardless of whether the libraries work, either individually or integrated together.
